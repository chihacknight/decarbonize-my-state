              For most Americans, more than half your carbon footprint comes
              from how you heat and power your home and from the car you drive.
              More than cutting out meat or single use plastics, the most
              impactful thing you can do – by far – is to eliminate your
              personal burning of fossil fuels:

              40% of US climate pollution comes from decisions made around the
              kitchen table. We can’t solve climate change if you don’t
              electrify your home – and nobody can do it but you.
