          <p>
            Carbon - a nonmetallic chemical element with atomic number 6 that
            readily forms compounds with many other elements and is a
            constituent of organic compounds in all known living tissues&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon Dioxide - a molecule consisting of one carbon atom and two
            oxygen atoms.&nbsp; A product of combustion, respiration and other
            natural processes.&nbsp; Also a greenhouse gas in excessive
            quantities.
          </p>
          <p>Decarbonize -&nbsp; to remove carbon from&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Electrification - the process of converting combustion engines,
            heating and cooking appliances from fossil fuels (mainly gasoline
            and natural gas) to electric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geothermal - The natural heat emanating from the Earth&rsquo;s core
            being conveyed by either magma or water to the Earth&rsquo;s surface
            where it can be converted to electricity or used to heat homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gasses (GHG) - any of various gaseous compounds (such as
            carbon dioxide or ozone) that absorb infrared light, trapping&nbsp;
            heat in the atmosphere, and contributes to the greenhouse effect
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse effect - the conversion of infrared light into
            heat.&nbsp; Most noticed in closed automobiles on a sunny day.
          </p>
          <p>Megawatt - a million watts</p>
          <p>
            MTCO2e - <strong>Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent</strong>{" "}
            or MTCO2e is the unit of measurement in this tool. The unit "CO2e"
            represents an amount of a GHG whose atmospheric impact has been
            standardized to that of one unit mass of carbon dioxide (CO2), based
            on the global warming potential (GWP) of the gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Renewable Energy - Electricity which is produced by either wind,
            solar or geothermal sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watt -&nbsp; a unit of electric work&nbsp; or the power produced by
            a current of one ampere across a potential difference of one volt{" "}
            <strong>: </strong>&sup1;/₇₄₆ horsepower
