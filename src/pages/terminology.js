        <p>
          Carbon - a nonmetallic chemical element with atomic number 6 that
          readily forms compounds with many other elements and is a constituent
          of organic compounds in all known living tissues&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Carbon Dioxide - a molecule consisting of one carbon atom and two
          oxygen atoms.&nbsp; A product of combustion, respiration and other
          natural processes.&nbsp; Also a greenhouse gas in excessive
          quantities.
        </p>
        <p>Decarbonize -&nbsp; to remove carbon from&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Electrification - the process of converting combustion engines,
          heating and cooking appliances from fossil fuels (mainly gasoline and
          natural gas) to electric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geothermal - The natural heat emanating from the Earth&rsquo;s core
          being conveyed by either magma or water to the Earth&rsquo;s surface
          where it can be converted to electricity or used to heat homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greenhouse gasses (GHG) - any of various gaseous compounds (such as
          carbon dioxide or ozone) that absorb infrared light, trapping&nbsp;
          heat in the atmosphere, and contributes to the greenhouse effect
        </p>
        <p>
          Greenhouse effect - the conversion of infrared light into heat.&nbsp;
          Most noticed in closed automobiles on a sunny day.
        </p>
        <p>Megawatt - a million watts</p>
        <p>
          MTCO2e - <strong>Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent</strong> or
          MTCO2e is the unit of measurement in this tool. The unit "CO2e"
          represents an amount of a GHG whose atmospheric impact has been
          standardized to that of one unit mass of carbon dioxide (CO2), based
          on the global warming potential (GWP) of the gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renewable Energy - Electricity which is produced by either wind, solar
          or geothermal sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watt -&nbsp; a unit of electric work&nbsp; or the power produced by a
          current of one ampere across a potential difference of one volt{" "}
          <strong>: </strong>&sup1;/₇₄₆ horsepower
